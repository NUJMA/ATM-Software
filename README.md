# ATM-Software
This project is a simple and interactive ATM Simulation Program built using Python. It demonstrates basic banking operations and helps users understand how an ATM system works internally. The program focuses on user-friendly interaction, clear logic, and smooth execution of all core ATM features.

💡 Features

User Authentication
The program validates user PIN input to ensure secure access.

Balance Inquiry
Users can easily check their current account balance.

Cash Withdrawal
Allows users to withdraw a chosen amount with proper balance verification.

Cash Deposit
Users can deposit money, and the updated balance is immediately shown.

Exit Option
The system ends safely when the user chooses to exit.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Basic input/output functions

Conditional statements

Loops for repeated operations

Simple error handling

📌 How It Works

The program starts by asking for a PIN. Once authenticated, the user can choose from multiple ATM options such as checking balance, withdrawing cash, depositing money, or exiting. Each function is handled through clean Python logic, making the project easy to understand and modify.
